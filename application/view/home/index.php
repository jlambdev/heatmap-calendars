    	<p>Welcome to AFWC, a prototype data visualisation utility for
    	the Schools of Biology and Marine Science/Technology.</p>

      <p>The application provides workload calendar views using assessment data. The assessment data can
      be accessed and modified from the 'Data' tab if you have Administrator / Power User permissions. Module
      combinations can be created with any type of account. Go to the 'Visualisation' tab to view your combinations,
      or custom workload views based on specific modules. View workloads from a student's perspective, or a staff member's
      perspective and filter results in terms of assessment or feedback types.</p>
